# High-temperature-Electrolysis

I think that hydrogen is the future of green energy. Now I'm focusing on High-temperature Electrolysis. The idea is to create steam and electroly it at the same time under the sun.

One parabol mirror heat up the water pipe to create steam, other solar panel generate electric to electroly steam into hydrogen and oxygen.

Hopefully that it will work and can be applied in industrial field.
